# Speed Reader by a110

This app is intended to help the user improve their reading speed by displaying the words
of a text passage one by one at a given speed. That effectively prevents the reader from
subvocalizing or regressing. For more background on the contextual meaning of these terms,
visit the [Wikipedia page on Speed Reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_reading) -
the content of which is used as the default text passage within the app.

The text used in the app can be easily replaced by any other text that might be more
applicable to the specific use case.

The styling could use refinement and in particular there is no support as yet for a dark
mode view. Also the deployment originally intended with GitHub Pages was not possible due
to the behavior of the main app at [a110.dev](https://a110.dev). Thus for the time being
this app can be viewed via Netlify at [https://main--velvety-gumdrop-c43a77.netlify.app/](https://main--velvety-gumdrop-c43a77.netlify.app/)
